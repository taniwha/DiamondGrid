# All objects that look like a model (no parent, has children) and is enabled
# for render will be exported as objectname.mu (without blender's numeric
# suffix (eg, foo.001 -> foo.mu), and any blender images referenced by the
# exported mu files will be exported with ".png" appended to their names
# (note that they must be packed in the blend, and they will be exported as
# png). foo.cfg.in -> foo.cfg is handled as if exported manually.
